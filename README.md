# Tabular - Micro-Frontend Task Board

Hello, everyone! Welcome to Tabular - a micro-frontend web app designed to simplify task management. Tabular provides a user-friendly Task Board where you can effortlessly create, update, delete, and move tasks across different columns as they progress. It's not just a task board; it's a showcase of robust software development, elegant user interface design, and thorough testing.

## Features

- Create, update, delete, and move tasks across columns.
- Assign team members to tasks.
- Save and load the board for later use.
- Clear the board when tasks are completed.

## Technologies Used

Tabular is a result of utilizing cutting-edge technologies:

- Figma for design mockups.
- Next.js for a powerful React framework.
- React, Typescript, and Material UI for a seamless user interface.
- CSS-in-JS for styling.
- Jest and React Testing Library for comprehensive testing.
- Atlassian's drag-and-drop package for smooth task movements.
- Deployment on Vercel for easy cloud hosting.

## Project Structure

The project follows a meticulous development process:

1. **Requirement Engineering:** Defined user stories and system requirements.
2. **Design:** Utilized Figma for design mockups and system design.
3. **Implementation:** Used a test-driven development approach.
4. **Deployment:** Deployed the application on Vercel.

## How to Run

To get started with Tabular, follow these simple steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://lnkd.in/gbBFzNyn`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd tabular`
3. Install dependencies: `npm install` (or `yarn install`, `pnpm install`, `bun install`)
4. Run the development server: `npm run dev` (or `yarn dev`, `pnpm dev`, `bun dev`)
5. Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser.

## Future Plans

I plan on extending Tabular by incorporating a simple GraphQL server to enhance data handling on the task board. Stay tuned for updates!
